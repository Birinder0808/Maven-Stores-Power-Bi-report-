# Maven Store Power Bi report-
This is a report generated by using Microsoft Power Bi on the daily transactional data of Maven Stores from 1997 and 1998.
I worked through the entire business intelligence workflow: connecting and shaping the source data, building a relational model, adding calculated columns and measures, and designing an interactive report. The source file and every format of Power Bi reports is uploaded here in this repository.

As you can see there are first 3 files with same name but with different format. These are final reports.
Other are the CSV files starting with maven markets, these are all the resources files I needed for the report creation.
